# Baremetal F´ project

This project is an implementation of F´ on baremetal hardware, specifically for Arduino based microcontrollers. 

The BaremetalReference is a reference to run F´ on embedded systems with hardware constraints. Therefore, this deployment only consists of basic/essential F´ components, with the addition of LED blinker, radio, and IMU components.
